# Contributing to LeForge

Thanks for helping. LeForge is a vendor-neutral platform; contributions that add
coupling to a specific cloud, model vendor or proprietary runtime will not be
merged into core — put them behind one of the extension interfaces instead
(see [docs/extensibility.md](docs/extensibility.md)).

## Development setup

Install Git and Make. Docker with Compose is required for the container workflow:
Go runs in a container through `scripts/go.sh`, and Compose starts the full stack.
`make test` also requires local Python and Node.js/npm for the SDK, example agents
and console tests; these targets do not skip when the tools are missing.

### Local toolchain versions

Use the following version lines to match the project's existing containers:

| Tool | Development version | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | Latest patch in 1.26 | [server/go.mod](server/go.mod) requires 1.26.0; [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [scripts/go.sh](scripts/go.sh) use `golang:1.26-alpine`. |
| Python | Latest patch in 3.12 | [agents/Dockerfile](agents/Dockerfile) uses `python:3.12-slim`; the [SDK](sdk/python/pyproject.toml) supports Python 3.10+. |
| Node.js | Latest patch in 22, at least 22.22.2 | [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses `node:22-alpine`; dependencies in [web/package-lock.json](web/package-lock.json) require 22.22.2 or newer within Node 22. |
| npm | Bundled with the selected Node.js | Use `npm ci` with the committed web lockfile. |

Choose either asdf or mise below, or install these tools directly. A version
manager is optional. Run the setup commands from the repository root in Bash or
Zsh. They select versions for this checkout, not global defaults. The repository
does not currently commit a version-manager configuration; these commands create
one locally and resolve exact patch versions at setup time. Keep personal
`.tool-versions` or `mise.toml` files out of unrelated commits. The source files
above remain authoritative when updating versions.

### Option A: asdf

Follow the [asdf installation and shell setup guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started)
first, including adding its shims directory to `PATH`. These commands use the
current `asdf set` syntax (asdf 0.16+).

Add each plugin once; omit any already listed by `asdf plugin list`:

```bash
asdf plugin add golang https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang.git
asdf plugin add python https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-python.git
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
```

The Python plugin builds from source. Install its platform-specific
[build dependencies](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-python#install)
before installing Python.

```bash
asdf set golang latest:1.26
asdf set python latest:3.12
asdf set nodejs latest:22
asdf install
asdf current
```

[`asdf set`](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html) records the resolved
versions in `.tool-versions`. Subsequent `asdf install` calls reuse those versions.

### Option B: mise

Follow the [mise installation guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)
and [shell setup](https://mise.jdx.dev/shells.html) first. For example, add
`eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` to `~/.zshrc`, or `eval "$(mise activate bash)"`
to `~/.bashrc`, then open a new shell.

```bash
mise use --pin go@1.26 python@3.12 node@22
mise current
```

[`mise use --pin`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/use.html) installs the tools and
records exact versions in `mise.toml`. Subsequent `mise install` calls reuse
those versions. If you have not activated mise in your shell, run commands with
`mise exec --`, for example `mise exec -- make test-python`.

### Verify and develop

From the repository root, check that your shell resolves the selected tools:

```bash
go version
python3 --version
node --version
npm --version
git --version
make --version
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Start Docker before running the container-backed targets:

```bash
make build        # forged + forge into server/bin
make test         # Go, Python, web type-check and Vitest tests
make lint         # gofmt + go vet
make up           # full stack via docker compose
```

`make build`, `make test-go` and `make lint` still use Docker even when Go is
installed locally. For native Go development, run `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`
and `go build ./...` from `server/`; see
[running without Docker](docs/getting-started.md#5-run-without-docker) for native
binaries and startup instructions. `make test-python` and `make test-web` run
locally and do not require Docker. The Python tests use the standard library and
the SDK source tree; no optional agent framework installation is required.

For the console development server:

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev:mock  # fixture-backed UI, no backend required
# or: npm run dev  # proxies API requests to the backend on port 8080
```

Live broker/database suites are skipped unless their environment variables are
set: `LEFORGE_TEST_NATS_URL`, `LEFORGE_TEST_REDIS_URL`,
`LEFORGE_TEST_RABBITMQ_URL`, `LEFORGE_TEST_KAFKA_BROKERS`,
`LEFORGE_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`.

## Ground rules

- **Contracts first.** The wire contracts (`docs/dev/contracts.md`, the JSON
  tags in `server/internal/domain`, `runtime`, `llm`, `tools`) are public API.
  Additive changes only; anything else needs an ADR in `docs/adr/`.
- **Adapters pass conformance.** A new broker must pass
  `queue/conformance`; a new store must pass `storage/conformance`.
- **Metric names are contracts.** Add metrics, never rename them
  (`server/internal/observability/metrics.go`).
- **Security defaults stay closed.** Tool grants are default-deny; new tools
  declare a capability and enforce their own constraints (paths, commands,
  hosts) through the helpers in `server/internal/tools/policy.go`.
- **Tests** accompany every behaviour change. Engine behaviour is tested
  end-to-end in `server/internal/engine/engine_test.go`.
- Run `make lint test` before opening a pull request. Keep commits focused and
  describe the *why* in the message.

## Architecture decisions

Significant decisions are recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Propose a new one
(next number, status "Proposed") in the same pull request as the change.
