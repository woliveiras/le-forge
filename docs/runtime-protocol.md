# Runtime Protocol v1

The Runtime Protocol is how agents written in **any language or framework** (LangGraph, AutoGen,
CrewAI, plain code) take part in a LeForge graph. It is two HTTP endpoints on the agent side and
eight callback endpoints on the platform side. The Python SDK (`sdk/python`, package `leforge`)
implements it; this page is the specification for everyone else.

Schemas: [`schemas/turn.schema.json`](../schemas/turn.schema.json) (TurnInput, TurnResult, Emit),
[`schemas/message.schema.json`](../schemas/message.schema.json), and the `runtime-callback` tag of
[`api/openapi.yaml`](../api/openapi.yaml). Go source of truth: `server/internal/runtime/runtime.go`.

## Division of responsibility

| The engine (platform) | The runtime (your agent) |
|---|---|
| Decides when a turn starts (loop mode, schedule, stop policy, pause, approvals) | Turns `TurnInput` into a `TurnResult` |
| Claims input messages, extends their leases, acks/nacks/dead-letters them | Never touches the broker |
| Routes and publishes emitted messages | Says *what* to emit (type, payload, optional target/channel) |
| Executes tools under the node's grants (tool gateway) | Asks for tools through the callback |
| Holds model credentials; calls providers (LLM gateway) | Asks for completions through the callback |
| Persists memory (KV), executions, history, events | Reads/writes memory through the callback |

Consequences: an agent process holds **no secrets**, can be shared by any number of replicas (the
protocol is stateless per turn), and cannot break delivery guarantees by being buggy.

## Agent-side endpoints

### `GET /v1/health`

`200 {"status":"ok","agents":["planner","reviewer"],"framework":"custom"}`. The engine polls it
(every 1 s, 3 s timeout) when a replica starts: for 30 s for `runtime.endpoint` services, 90 s for
runtimes it launched itself. Any non-200 counts as not ready.

### `POST /v1/turn`

Request body: `TurnInput`. Response: `200` with `TurnResult`. Dispatch on `TurnInput.agent`
(the node's `runtime.agent`, default the node id).

| Header (request) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type: application/json` | always |
| `X-Leforge-Runtime-Secret` | sent when the platform has `runtimes.sharedSecretEnv` set; reject turns without the right value (constant-time compare) |
| `traceparent` / `tracestate` | W3C trace context of the `agent.turn` span; continue it to see your spans inside the platform trace |

#### TurnInput (abridged)

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `executionId` | string | Id of this turn; also in the callback URL |
| `graphId`, `graphName`, `nodeId`, `nodeName` | string | Where you are |
| `replica`, `replicas` | int | Your index and the configured cluster size |
| `iteration` | int | Lifetime turn counter of this replica (survives restarts) |
| `agent` | string | Agent to dispatch to |
| `prompt` | string | Node prompt with `@parameters` substituted |
| `system` | string | Platform preamble (situation, inputs, outputs, tools, stop protocol) — prepend it to your model prompt |
| `inputs` | Message[] | Messages claimed for this turn (they are leased to you) |
| `operatorMessages` | string[] | Human messages addressed to this replica |
| `neighbors` | `{replica,text,at}[]` | Ring clusters: latest broadcast of the two neighbours |
| `outputs` | `{channel,type,targets,types?,when?}[]` | Where emits can go |
| `tools` | `{name,description,parameters}[]` | Tools you are granted (JSON Schema parameters) |
| `maxToolCalls` | int, optional | The node's tool-call budget for this turn (`limits.maxToolCalls`); the gateway enforces it, use it to size your own loop |
| `model` | `{provider,name,temperature?,maxTokens?}` | The node's model reference |
| `pendingStop` | bool | Last turn declared `no_further_work`: find work or return `confirm_stop` |
| `workdir`, `branch` | string | The replica's workspace (as the *platform's* tools see it) and git branch |
| `parameters`, `config` | object | Graph parameters; node `config` verbatim |
| `callback` | `{url, token}` | How to reach the platform during this turn |

#### TurnResult

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `emits` | Emit[] (≤ 1000 per turn, with callback emits) | Output messages; published only if the turn succeeds |
| `summary` | string | Shown in the console and stored on the execution (≤ 4000 chars kept) |
| `broadcast` | string | Ring clusters: the line neighbours read next turn |
| `signal` | `""` \| `no_further_work` \| `confirm_stop` | Auto-stop handshake (nodes with `stop.policy: auto`) |
| `usage` | `{inputTokens, outputTokens}` | Tokens you spent *outside* the LLM callback (callback usage is counted already) |
| `toolCalls` | int | Tool calls made outside the callback (informational) |
| `retry` | bool | "Not now": the inputs are nacked and redelivered with back-off instead of acked |

`Emit = {type, payload, target?, channel?, metadata?}`. Routing: `channel` forces one of the node's
outputs; otherwise `target` narrows to outputs reaching that node; otherwise every output whose
`types` filter and `when` condition match. Reserved metadata keys (`graph`, `hops`, `traceparent`,
…) are ignored.

## Callback endpoints

Base URL: `TurnInput.callback.url` (e.g. `http://forged:8080/internal/v1/executions/exe_…`).
Every request: `Authorization: Bearer <callback.token>`.

| Method & path | Body → Response | Errors |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /tools` | → `ToolSchema[]` (granted only) | |
| `POST /tools/{name}` | tool args object → `{content, data?, isError?, truncated?}` | 403 denied/rejected, 404 unknown tool, 429 rate limited. Tool *failures* are `200` with `isError: true` |
| `POST /llm/chat` | `ChatRequest` (omit `model` for the node's) → `ChatResponse` | 502 `llm_error` (provider failure, token budget exhausted) |
| `POST /emit` | `Emit` → `{"queued":true}` | 400 invalid emit |
| `GET /state/{key}` | → raw bytes | 404 absent |
| `PUT /state/{key}` | raw bytes (≤ 1 MiB) → 204 | |
| `POST /output` | `{text}` → 204 | |
| `POST /ask` | `{question}` → `{answer}` (blocks until a human answers) | 409 `no_answer` (rejected/expired) |

State keys are URL path-escaped (they may contain `/` and `:`); state is shared by **all replicas
of the node** (namespace `<graph>/<node>`), which is what a cluster needs for shared counters.

### Token scoping

The token is 192 random bits, created when the turn starts and destroyed when it ends. It
authorises exactly: tools under this node's grants, the node's model (any model name on the node's
provider), emits into this turn, this node's state, narration and questions for this replica.
A token for a finished or unknown execution gets `401`. Tokens are held in memory by the instance
running the turn, so `callback.url` always points at that instance (`server.internalUrl`).

## Timeouts, failures and retries

| Situation | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Turn exceeds `limits.turnTimeout` (default 30 m) | Request cancelled; turn **failed**; inputs nacked with back-off |
| Non-2xx from `/v1/turn`, connection error, invalid JSON | Turn **failed**; inputs nacked with exponential back-off (`retryBackoff × 2^(attempt-1)`, ≤ 5 m) |
| Output construction or publication fails after the runtime returns | Turn **failed**; stop remaining emits; no input is acked or marked processed. Inputs are nacked with back-off, or dead-lettered at `maxDeliver`. Outputs already published are not rolled back. |
| `retry: true` | Same as failed, without counting as an error in your code path |
| Inputs reach the channel's `maxDeliver` (default 5) | Dead-lettered; visible as `dead_lettered` in history |
| Operator `kill` | Request cancelled; turn **cancelled**; inputs redelivered immediately |
| Platform crash mid-turn | Execution marked **interrupted** by whoever takes the replica over; inputs redelivered after the broker lease (`ackWait`) |

Publication success includes durable acceptance at a human approval gate; the producer does not wait for the human decision. Intentional routing drops (no matching route or hop limit) are not publication failures.

**Idempotency expectations.** Delivery is at-least-once: the same input message can reach your
agent more than once (after a failed turn, a crash, or a broker redelivery). The engine deduplicates
messages already acked by the same consumer group, but side effects you performed *during* a failed
turn (files written, external calls) are not rolled back. A publication failure can also leave
partial outputs delivered; a retried turn emits new message IDs, so downstream agents must
tolerate duplicates. Write turns so that re-running them is
safe — key outputs by input message id or `metadata.correlation_id`, overwrite rather than append.

Callbacks: `GET /tools`, `GET/PUT /state`, `POST /output` are safe to retry. `POST /tools/{name}`
and `POST /llm/chat` may have side effects/cost — retry only on connection errors before a response,
and only for idempotent tools. `POST /emit` is not idempotent (each call queues a message).

## Versioning policy

* The path prefix carries the major version (`/v1/turn`, `/internal/v1`).
* Within v1, fields are only **added**. Agents must ignore unknown fields; the platform ignores
  unknown fields in `TurnResult`.
* A breaking change creates `/v2/…`; the platform will serve both for at least one minor release.

## Minimal agent without the SDK (Node.js, no dependencies)

```js
// echo-agent.mjs — forwards every input as "<type>.seen", asks the model for a one-line summary.
import http from "node:http";

const call = (cb, method, path, body) =>
  fetch(cb.url + path, {
    method,
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${cb.token}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: body === undefined ? undefined : JSON.stringify(body),
  }).then(async (r) => { if (!r.ok) throw new Error(`${path}: ${r.status}`); return r.status === 204 ? null : r.json(); });

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const send = (code, obj) => { res.writeHead(code, { "Content-Type": "application/json" }); res.end(JSON.stringify(obj)); };
  if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/v1/health") return send(200, { status: "ok", agents: ["echo"], framework: "custom" });
  if (req.method !== "POST" || req.url !== "/v1/turn") return send(404, { error: "not found" });
  if (process.env.LEFORGE_RUNTIME_SECRET && req.headers["x-leforge-runtime-secret"] !== process.env.LEFORGE_RUNTIME_SECRET)
    return send(401, { error: "bad secret" });
  let raw = ""; for await (const chunk of req) raw += chunk;
  const turn = JSON.parse(raw);
  try {
    const chat = await call(turn.callback, "POST", "/llm/chat", {
      system: turn.system,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: `${turn.prompt}\n\n${JSON.stringify(turn.inputs.map((m) => m.payload))}` }],
    });
    await call(turn.callback, "POST", "/output", { text: chat.message.content });
    const emits = turn.inputs.map((m) => ({ type: `${m.type}.seen`, payload: { summary: chat.message.content, of: m.id } }));
    send(200, { emits, summary: `handled ${turn.inputs.length} message(s)` });
  } catch (e) {
    send(500, { error: String(e) }); // the engine nacks the inputs and retries with back-off
  }
}).listen(Number(process.env.PORT ?? 8000), process.env.HOST ?? "0.0.0.0");
```

Wire it into a graph:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: echo
    runtime: {kind: external, agent: echo, endpoint: http://echo-agent:8000}
    # or launched by the platform: {kind: external, command: ["node", "echo-agent.mjs"]} (process isolation)
    # or {kind: external, image: my/echo-agent:1.0} with isolation: {mode: docker}
```

Launched runtimes receive `PORT`, `HOST`, `LEFORGE_URL` and `LEFORGE_RUNTIME_SECRET` in a minimal
environment (no platform secrets), are shared by all replicas of the node, and are stopped when the
last replica stops.

## Instruction snapshots

`TurnInput.instructions` is an optional immutable manifest (see [schema](../schemas/instructions.schema.json)). It is untrusted data, never permissions. The Python SDK retains it in `TurnInput.instructions`. Opted-in guidance precedes the original node prompt; operator/task text is preserved. Graphs without opt-in retain their original prompt and operator messages. See [composition, budgets and failure behavior](instructions.md).
