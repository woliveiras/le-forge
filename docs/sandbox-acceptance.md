# Sandbox release acceptance

The supported scope is repository discovery or an initial developer-approved
proposal, real isolated execution, compatible image/cache-seed reuse, bounded
active resources, idle resume and reference-safe cleanup. This closes the sandbox
workstream, not the remaining Release 1 product workstreams.

## Evidence map

| Contract | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Priority, malformed input, containment | Discovery/selection/context/stages unit tests, API integration; real browser matrix for LeForge YAML, devcontainer, Dockerfile and Compose |
| Initial proposal gate, stale/rejected/cancelled/failed work | Analysis/proposals/agent_tools unit and integration tests; browser approval/recovery; real gateway → persisted approval → build → continuation |
| Real shell, isolated workspaces and prepared-image reuse | Real browser uid 10001 commands, distinct workdirs and file markers, shared image inspection inside the dedicated daemon |
| Cache seeds, invalidation, concurrent builders and cleanup | Reuse/cleanup unit, storage/API and live tests; real browser lockfile rebuild and Reset preserving the other task |
| CPU/memory/count, build/setup admission and cancellation | Capacity/progress integration and cgroup tests; browser CPU-only/memory-only execution waits, cancellation/retry and preparation wait followed by setup |
| Idle resume | Engine/storage/queue tests, real container stop/start and preserved workspace/cache files; browser Files view before/after message-driven resume |
| Network restrictions and diagnostics | Policy/egress/history/retention unit, API/storage/UI integration and dedicated-daemon runtime/build/setup tests |
| Representative mise repository | [Runnable example](../examples/projects/mise-node/README.md); approval, pinned tool/dependency installation, offline build/tests, second-task reuse and private caches/workspaces |

The real-browser suite scripts only model inference; approval, persistence,
Docker builds/setup, native `shell.exec` and workspace writes use real components.
The deterministic-browser suite additionally scripts Docker and uses the echo
runtime; it verifies orchestration, not container isolation. Neither suite
measures external model proposal quality.

## Validation record — 2026-10-16

- `make test`: Go unit/integration suites (unchanged packages used Go’s result cache), 8 Python SDK and 14 agent tests,
  web type-check and 112 tests across 17 files passed. Optional broker/live-daemon
  tests are environment-gated; dedicated sandbox coverage is run separately below.
- `make lint`: gofmt and Go vet passed.
- `make build`: forged, forge and forge-egress built successfully.
- `make test-e2e`: fixture unit tests, E2E type-check, production console build
  and 10 Chromium journeys passed.
- `make test-e2e-real`: fixture unit tests, E2E type-check, production console
  build and 6 Chromium journeys passed on the dedicated daemon.
- `make test-environment-context`: all 6 real suites passed (agent proposal,
  build capacity, shared cleanup, COPY/ADD/stages/external images, initial
  proposal and reuse); run without test-result cache.
- `make test-sandbox-capacity`: real capacity and idle lifecycle tests passed.
- `make test-compose`: reviewed service group isolation, resource caps,
  suspension/resume and independent teardown passed.
- `make test-environment-policy`: real build/setup/runtime policy enforcement
  and cached-image revocation passed.
- `make test-egress`: runtime and preparation proxy tests passed, including
  approved/denied/private destinations, direct-egress blocking, diagnostics,
  persistent history and configured retention.
- `make test-sandbox`: all checks passed: mutual TLS, image inside the dedicated
  daemon, network-none isolation, bridge blocking of daemon/gateway/control
  plane, permitted public internet, and no LeForge sandboxes on the host daemon.

The mise example pins its public image and Node version and commits its npm
lockfile. `.dockerignore` excludes installed dependencies and generated outputs.
An initial run without those exclusions correctly blocked continuation after
setup changed the approved context; the corrected example passed end to end.
The second task shares the prepared image and compatible npm cache seed, not
another task's writable volume, node_modules or installed toolchain. Setup reruns.

## Limits retained deliberately

- Supported subsets of Compose and devcontainer; unsupported definitions fail
  validation. Initial proposals require no existing accepted definition;
  replacement proposals/diffs are a later workflow.
- Reuse fingerprints cover accepted contexts and bounded manifests/lockfiles,
  not every repository file or a full Git revision. Declare build inputs and
  exclude generated outputs deliberately. Mutable image tags are not immutable
  identities; pin digests where reproducibility matters.
- Idle suspension retains files and reuses stopped containers between turns;
  it does not checkpoint process memory or promise arbitrary restart continuity.
- CPU/memory/count reservations cover managed workers, not the entire VM or
  daemon pull/load/commit overhead. Wait reasons are visible; exact queue
  positions and ETAs are not provided.
- Runtime/build/setup HTTP/HTTPS egress controls do not govern daemon registry
  pulls. Diagnostics are sampled and bounded, not a guaranteed audit trail.
- Cleanup only removes eligible registered resources after reference checks;
  unregistered legacy resources remain untouched.
- Validation used the existing Docker-in-Docker service on Colima (Linux arm64).
  The optional rootless deployment variant remains unchecked in the checklist;
  this record does not claim it or other operating systems were validated.
