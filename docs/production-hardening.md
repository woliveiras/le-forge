# Production hardening

The defaults of `docker compose up` optimise for a working platform in one
command. This checklist turns a deployment into one you can run unattended
with real models, real code bases and real credentials. Each item names the
setting or file that implements it.

## Identity and access

- [ ] **Use a strong admin token.** Set `LEFORGE_ADMIN_TOKEN` (≥ 32 random
      bytes) only for break-glass access.
- [ ] **Use OIDC for people** (`auth.oidc`: issuer, audience, `roleClaim`);
      map groups to `viewer` / `operator` / `admin`. Admin (graph edits) should
      be a small group; approvers need `operator`.
- [ ] **Scoped tokens for automation** (`auth.tokens` with `tokenFile` from
      mounted secrets): CI gets `operator` or `admin` per need; dashboards get
      `viewer`.
- [ ] **Rotate tokens** by adding the new token, rolling clients, removing the
      old one (tokens are re-read at startup; roll instances).
- [ ] **Set `LEFORGE_RUNTIME_SECRET`** (`runtimes.sharedSecretEnv`) on forged and
      every external runtime so only the platform can start turns.
- [ ] Never set `LEFORGE_AUTH_DISABLED` outside a laptop.

## Network

- [ ] **TLS termination** at the ingress/load balancer; forged speaks plain
      HTTP inside the cluster/host network.
- [ ] **Do not expose `/internal/v1`** publicly — only agent runtimes need it,
      and they reach instances directly (`server.internalUrl` = pod IP).
- [ ] **Restrict `/metrics`** to the monitoring network.
- [ ] **NetworkPolicies** (`deploy/kubernetes/networkpolicies.yaml`): default
      deny; agents may only reach forged; forged egress limited to broker,
      database, telemetry, model servers and approved external APIs.
- [ ] **Egress control for `http.fetch`**: grant `hosts` allowlists in graphs;
      keep `tools.allowPrivateNetworks: false` (SSRF guard); add an egress
      proxy/FQDN policy for defence in depth.
- [ ] `server.corsOrigins` empty unless a separate console origin is required.

## Secrets

- [ ] Model keys only via `apiKeyEnv`/`apiKeyFile` from a secret manager
      (Kubernetes Secrets via External Secrets/Sealed Secrets/SOPS, Vault
      agent, Docker secrets). The gateway is the only holder; agents never see
      them.
- [ ] Start forged with a **clean environment**: the process sandbox scrubs
      the environment for commands, but anything the server inherits is a
      liability.
- [ ] Database and broker credentials with least privilege (no superuser;
      NATS user limited to the `leforge.>` subjects).

## Isolation of agent work

- [ ] **Grants are the first boundary**: default deny; narrow with `paths`,
      `commands`, `hosts`, `rateLimit`; avoid `*` (validation warns).
- [ ] **Treat `shell.exec` as code execution.** The process sandbox confines
      the working directory, environment and timeout but not system calls. For
      untrusted repositories or inputs use `isolation.mode: docker`
      (no network, all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, CPU/memory
      limits), or run forged under a sandboxed runtime class
      (**gVisor** `runsc` or **Kata Containers**) on Kubernetes.
- [ ] Run docker isolation on a daemon dedicated to LeForge — never mount the
      host's Docker socket into forged (root on that host). Compose ships
      `sandbox-daemon` for this; it is privileged Docker-in-Docker, so run
      LeForge on a dedicated host or VM. Keep agents on `network: none`
      unless they must download packages. See [sandbox runtime](sandbox-runtime.md).
- [ ] Containers: non-root (uid 10001), read-only root filesystem, seccomp
      `RuntimeDefault`, `automountServiceAccountToken: false` (the shipped
      manifests do this).
- [ ] Use `workspace.mode: worktree` for parallel writers; keep deliverables in
      git remotes with protected branches so agents cannot rewrite history
      that matters.

## LLM safety

- [ ] **Prompt injection posture**: inputs are framed as data in the preamble,
      but an autonomous agent can still be steered. Assume any agent with a
      tool can be made to use it; design grants accordingly.
- [ ] **Approval gates on destructive steps**: `requiresApproval: true` on
      grants such as `git.write`, `filesystem.delete`, deployment tools;
      `approval: true` on release channels; `approval.beforeTurn` on rarely-run
      high-impact nodes. Set `approval.timeout` + `onTimeout: reject`.
- [ ] Review third-party repositories before pointing agents at them
      (instructions in files are read by agents).
- [ ] Keep `maxHops` low enough to cut runaway cycles.

## Data and durability

- [ ] **PostgreSQL** with HA (operator or managed), continuous archiving and
      tested point-in-time restore.
- [ ] **NATS JetStream** as a 3-node cluster with `queue.options.replicas: "3"`
      (or Kafka RF 3 / RabbitMQ quorum queues / Redis with replication and AOF).
- [ ] **Retention**: set `channel.retention`; prune old events and message
      history on a schedule (database job) according to your audit policy;
      Loki/Tempo retention is configured in `deploy/observability/`.
- [ ] Backups for workspaces (or rely on git remotes); see [deployment](deployment.md#backup-and-restore).

## Reliability

- [ ] **≥ 2 forged instances** with PostgreSQL + clustered broker; PDB
      `minAvailable: 1`; spread across nodes/zones.
- [ ] **Lease TTL**: `engine.leaseTTL` trades failover time against
      sensitivity to pauses (GC, network). 20–30 s is a good default;
      `reconcileInterval` ≤ TTL/4.
- [ ] **Clock sync (NTP/chrony)** on all instances: lease expiry is evaluated
      with the calling instance's clock.
- [ ] **Graceful termination** longer than typical turns
      (`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, `stop_grace_period`); long turns that
      exceed it are cancelled and their inputs redelivered.
- [ ] **Bound concurrency**: `engine.maxConcurrentTurns` per instance;
      provider `concurrency` per model backend; `cluster.maxReplicas` per node.
- [ ] **Timeouts**: `limits.turnTimeout` per node; provider `timeoutSec` and
      `maxRetries`; channel `ackWait` larger than the longest expected turn
      (leases are extended during a turn, but `ackWait` bounds recovery time).
- [ ] **Idempotent agents**: delivery is at-least-once with dedupe by message
      id; external side effects (APIs, deployments) should use the message id
      as an idempotency key.

## Cost controls

- [ ] `limits.maxTokens` and `limits.maxToolCalls` per turn.
- [ ] Prefer `loop.mode: event` for consumers; set stop policies
      (`iterations`, `duration`, `auto`, `idle`) on producers and research loops.
- [ ] `loop.interval` / `scheduled` for loops polling external systems.
- [ ] Alert on token rate (`leforge_llm_tokens_total`) per provider/model.

## Observability

- [ ] Ship OTLP to your collector (`observability.otlpEndpoint`); sample traces
      (`traceSampleRatio` 0.1–0.2) at high volume — parent-based sampling keeps
      whole agent chains together.
- [ ] Load `deploy/observability/alerts.yaml` (dead letters, growing backlog,
      turn failure rate, waiting approvals, LLM errors) into Prometheus /
      Alertmanager and route them.
- [ ] Define SLOs, e.g. *95 % of messages start processing within 2 min*
      (`leforge_message_queue_latency_seconds`), *turn success ≥ 99 %*
      (`leforge_executions_total`), *API availability ≥ 99.9 %*.
- [ ] Log retention per policy; logs are JSON on stdout and OTLP, correlated
      with traces by trace id.
- [ ] The event log is your audit trail (tool calls, approvals with
      decider, graph changes with author): keep it as long as compliance requires.

## Supply chain

- [ ] Build images in CI from a pinned base, generate an **SBOM** (Syft) and
      scan (Grype/Trivy); fail on critical vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Sign images** (Cosign/Sigstore, or Notation) and enforce signatures at
      admission (Kyverno/Gatekeeper/Connaisseur).
- [ ] Deploy by **digest**, not tag; mirror third-party images (NATS,
      PostgreSQL, observability) into your registry.
- [ ] Pin Python agent dependencies and model versions; record the model in
      graph documents (`model.name`) so changes are reviewed.

## Capacity and resilience testing

- [ ] Load test with `runtime.kind: echo` graphs to measure broker/store
      throughput without model cost; then with a fixed local model.
- [ ] Chaos: kill a forged instance mid-turn and verify takeover after the
      lease TTL and redelivery of its inputs; restart the broker and database.
- [ ] Verify backups by restoring into a staging environment regularly.
