# Cross-component contracts (working reference)

> Superseded by the formal specifications: [api/openapi.yaml](../../api/openapi.yaml), [docs/api.md](../api.md),
> [docs/runtime-protocol.md](../runtime-protocol.md) and [schemas/](../../schemas). Kept as the original build-time
> agreement between components; where it differs, the formal specs (and the code) win.
>
> Cross-component design contracts for capabilities not yet implemented are in
> [product-contracts.md](../product-contracts.md); do not treat proposed operations there as shipped API.

This file is the single source of truth that the Go server, the React UI and
the Python SDK are built against while the full documentation is written.
Field names are exactly the JSON tags of the Go structs in
`server/internal/domain`, `server/internal/runtime`, `server/internal/llm`
and `server/internal/tools` (camelCase).

## 1. Public HTTP API (`/api/v1`)

Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request. EventSource (SSE)
cannot set headers, so `GET /api/v1/events/stream` also accepts
`?access_token=<token>`. Roles: `viewer` (GET), `operator` (+ start/stop,
inject, approve, operator messages), `admin` (+ create/update/delete graphs).
Errors: `{"error": "message", "code": "not_found|conflict|invalid|forbidden|unauthorized|internal", "details": [...]}`.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/info` | | `{version, instance, queue, storage, providers:[...], runtimes:[...], defaultProvider, grafanaUrl}` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs` | | `GraphSummary[]` |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs` | `Graph` (JSON, or YAML with `Content-Type: application/yaml`) | `GraphSummary` (201) |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs/validate` | `Graph` | `{valid, errors:[{path,message}], warnings:[{path,message}]}` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}` `?version=N` | | `GraphSummary` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}` (header `If-Match: <version>` optional) | `Graph` | `GraphSummary` (409 on version conflict) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}` | | 204 (409 if running) |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/versions` | | `[{version, createdAt, author}]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/export` `?format=yaml|json` | | the document |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/start|stop|pause|resume|kill` | | `GraphStatus` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/status` | | `GraphStatus` |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/nodes/{node}/start|stop|pause|resume|kill` | | `GraphStatus` |
| PUT | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/nodes/{node}/scale` | `{replicas}` | `GraphStatus` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/nodes/{node}/chat` | | `OperatorMessage[]` |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/nodes/{node}/chat` | `{text, replica?}` (replica -1/absent = any) | `OperatorMessage` |
| POST | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/channels/{channel}/messages` | `{type, payload, target?, metadata?}` | `Message` (201; held if channel has approval) |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/messages` `?channel=&node=&correlationId=&status=&limit=` | | `MessageRecord[]` (newest first) |
| GET | `/api/v1/messages/{messageId}` | | `MessageRecord[]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/executions` `?node=&status=&limit=` | | `Execution[]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/executions/{id}` | | `Execution` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/events` `?after=&node=&types=a,b&limit=` | | `Event[]` (ascending by seq) |
| GET | `/api/v1/events/stream` `?graph=&after=` | | SSE: `id: <seq>`, `event: <type>`, `data: <Event JSON>` |
| GET | `/api/v1/approvals` `?graph=&status=pending` | | `Approval[]` |
| POST | `/api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve|reject` | `{comment?, answer?}` | `Approval` |
| GET | `/api/v1/providers` | | `[{name, type, baseUrl, defaultModel, default}]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/providers/{name}/models` | | `ModelInfo[]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/tools` | | `[{name, capability, description, schema}]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/files` `?path=&node=&replica=` | | `[{name, path, dir, size, modTime}]` |
| GET | `/api/v1/graphs/{id}/files/content` `?path=&node=&replica=` | | file bytes (text/plain) |
| GET | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` | | |

```
GraphSummary = { graph: Graph, record: GraphRecord }
GraphStatus  = {
  graphId, state, desiredState, runId, version,
  nodes: [{ nodeId, name, state, desiredReplicas, replicas: ReplicaStatus[], pending, disabled }],
  channels: [{ channelId, type, from, to: [..], subject,
               groups: [{ group, node, replica?, pending, inFlight, dead }] }],
  approvalsPending
}
```

Node `state` in GraphStatus is the "most alive" replica state, in the
order running > awaiting_approval > starting > idle > paused > stopping >
failed > completed > stopped.

## 2. Runtime Protocol v1 (external agents)

An external runtime is an HTTP server (any language) exposing:

* `GET /v1/health` → `{"status":"ok","agents":["planner", ...],"framework":"..."}`
* `POST /v1/turn` body `TurnInput` → `TurnResult`. The agent is chosen by
  `TurnInput.agent`. Non-2xx = turn failed (inputs are redelivered).

During a turn the agent reaches the platform ONLY through
`TurnInput.callback.url` with header `Authorization: Bearer <callback.token>`:

| Method | Path (relative to callback.url) | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/tools/{toolName}` | tool arguments object | `{content, data?, isError?, truncated?}` (403 when denied) |
| GET | `/tools` | | `[{name, description, parameters}]` (granted tools only) |
| POST | `/llm/chat` | `ChatRequest` (`model` optional: node default) | `ChatResponse` |
| POST | `/emit` | `Emit` | `{"queued": true}` |
| GET | `/state/{key}` | | raw bytes (404 if absent) |
| PUT | `/state/{key}` | raw bytes | 204 |
| POST | `/output` | `{text}` | 204 |
| POST | `/ask` | `{question}` | `{answer}` (blocks until a human answers) |

callback.url looks like `http://forged:8080/internal/v1/executions/<executionId>`.
The token is valid only while the execution is running.

## 3. Turn semantics

* The engine claims up to `loop.batchSize` input messages, builds
  `TurnInput`, calls the runtime, then: publishes `TurnResult.emits` (plus
  anything emitted via callback) through the router, acks the inputs, and
  persists the execution. If the turn fails or returns `retry: true`, inputs
  are nacked with exponential backoff and redelivered (dead-lettered after
  `maxDeliver`).
* Emits are routed: `channel` set → that channel; else `target` set →
  outgoing channels whose consumers include target; else every outgoing
  channel whose `types` filter and `when` expression match. No match → the
  message is recorded as `dropped`.
* `signal: "no_further_work"` with `stop.policy: auto` arms the stop
  handshake; the next turn has `pendingStop: true` and must either do work
  or return `signal: "confirm_stop"`, which completes the replica.
* `broadcast` (ring clusters) is stored and shown to the two ring
  neighbours next turn as `neighbors`.

## 4. Native platform tools

Native agents get, in addition to their granted gateway tools, four
platform tools that need no grant: `emit {type, payload, target?, channel?}`,
`state_get {key}`, `state_set {key, value}`, `finish {signal, summary?, broadcast?}`.
Wire names use `__` for `.` (see `llm.WireToolName`).

### Delegation through the execution callback

Runtime Protocol v1 external parents may invoke `delegation.request` through the
existing tool callback with only `template` and `objective`. An exact grant and
managed model are required. The request waits for the installation's approval
policy and a server-managed native child result. Error envelopes, callback expiry,
cooperative cancellation and gateway admission limits apply. Do not retry uncertain
requests: no delegation idempotency key is defined. External child process launch
and model/runtime overrides are unsupported.

Gateway model usage and tool attempts are counted by the server. `TurnResult.usage`
and `toolCalls` represent only runtime-local work, never mirrored callback totals.
The Python SDK follows this contract; `ctx.delegate` returns a `ToolResult`, while
`ctx.add_usage` remains available for genuinely local inference.
