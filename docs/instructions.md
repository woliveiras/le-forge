# Skills and project steering

Open **Skills & steering** in the console. Administrators can create Markdown
skills, edit them into new revisions, toggle enabled/default flags, inspect
history and delete them logically. Viewers can inspect content; operators can
run graphs but cannot edit skills or graph associations. These are installation
resources, visible to the existing installation roles, not private user records.
Do not put credentials or other secrets in guidance.

Each skill has a stable DNS-style `id`, `title`, `description`, `body`, `enabled`
and `global` flag. It is inert UTF-8 Markdown: frontmatter, fenced commands,
links and requests to grant permissions remain text. Nothing is executed or
fetched. This release does not support script bundles, MCP or delegation.

## Association and precedence

Save graph/agent associations on the same screen. The whole graph is updated
with its version in `If-Match`; concurrent changes return a conflict and keep
the local edits. Inspection explicitly uses the **saved** configuration.

```yaml
spec:
  workspace: {path: example-project}
  instructions:
    installationDefaults: true
    skillIds: [review, conventions]
    projectSteering: true
  nodes:
    - id: writer
      skillIds: [conventions]
      prompt: Complete the assigned work
```

Existing workspace policy selects the graph directory or replica worktree.
`projectSteering: true` explicitly authorizes instruction reads from that
workspace. It does not authorize additional paths. The inspection API supports
`node` and `replica`; the console previews replica zero. Execution snapshots
always reflect the actual replica directory, including worktree contents.

Composition order, from lower to higher guidance precedence:

1. Installation defaults (`global: true`), in ID order, only when
   `installationDefaults: true`.
2. Graph skill IDs, in declared order. A node's `skillIds` may narrow this list;
   omitted/null inherits, an explicit empty array selects none. Node narrowing
   does not remove explicitly enabled installation defaults.
3. Immediate `.leforge/steering/*.md` files in bytewise filename order.
4. The agent prompt after parameter substitution.
5. Current operator messages, in the existing delivery order (task scope).

Later guidance wins for semantic conflicts; no attempt is made to interpret or
merge natural-language statements. Platform policies, tool grants, approval
requirements, limits and credentials are independent of this ordering.
Channel input payloads remain data under the existing runtime protocol.

Omitting `spec.instructions` preserves the original prompt and operator
messages byte-for-byte, including legacy size behavior. A new
`installationDefaults` opt-in makes the existing contract's “no application
skills when omitted” compatible with installation-wide defaults.

## Bounds and rejection

- Managed bodies and repository files: 16 KiB each, UTF-8, no NUL, nonblank.
  Titles/descriptions have 200/1000-byte limits.
- At most 128 graph skill references and 128 immediate repository entries.
  If the directory exceeds this cap, the whole project set is omitted with
  `file_count_limit`; filesystem enumeration order never picks a random subset.
  Installation defaults load at most 128 IDs; further defaults are reported
  by an aggregate `entry_count_limit` omission.
- Each skill retains at most 128 revisions; further updates fail explicitly.
  Existing records remain readable. A future archival API can extend this
  bound; there is no silent pruning.
- Opted-in guidance has an 8192-byte conservative token budget (one UTF-8 byte
  charged per possible token, including guidance framing). This is not an
  exact model tokenizer or the full model context window. The existing model
  gateway still checks the full request, including tools/messages/system text.
- Agent and operator task text reserve budget **before** optional guidance.
  If mandatory content exceeds the budget, execution fails before the runtime
  is called, records the reason, and restores consumed operator messages.
  Otherwise oversized optional entries are omitted whole, never truncated.
- Duplicate skill references are graph validation errors. Duplicate IDs across
  defaults/graph selections load once and record `duplicate`. Identical project
  bodies load once and record `duplicate_content` on later files.
- Missing/disabled/deleted selected skills are recorded as omissions. Corrupt
  settings or failed storage reads/writes fail execution, never masquerade as
  an empty successful load.
- Missing directories, unreadable entries, invalid text, unsupported extensions,
  symlinks and special files produce explicit omission reasons. No ancestor,
  home-directory, `AGENTS.md` or recursive search occurs. Directory/file
  symlinks encountered during inspection are rejected. Reads use `os.Root`
  containment even across path replacement races and nonblocking opens prevent
  FIFO substitution from hanging a turn. Hard links are ordinary workspace
  files; deployments must prevent untrusted creation of cross-boundary hard
  links at the filesystem/sandbox layer.

## Persistence, API and audit

`GET/POST /api/v1/skills` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/skills/{sid}` expose the
registry. Writes require admin; PUT/DELETE require a positive `If-Match`.
Creation requires a fresh ID. Reads include `history`; individual reads/writes
return an ETag. Invalid fields return 422, malformed JSON/headers return 400,
and stale versions return 409. DELETE creates a disabled tombstone rather
than removing data; PUT can restore it in a new revision. Deletion is refused
while any latest or active graph version references the skill, a conservative
superset of the original active-graph guard. Concurrent graph edits and skill
updates are not a cross-resource transaction: snapshots always record what was
actually resolved, and a disabled/missing skill is transparently omitted.

Storage uses existing settings CAS, one `instructions/skills/{id}` document
with current revision and retained history. The successful atomic write stores
actor/time/revision together; this is the authoritative mutation audit even if
live event delivery fails. `instruction.skill.updated` carries only ID,
revision, actor and deletion state, never the body.

Before runtime invocation the engine creates
`instructions/executions/{executionId}` exactly once (CAS revision zero).
The immutable snapshot contains graph/node/execution IDs and entries with
scope, source, revision (managed skills), SHA-256, included body or omission
reason. Oversized repository content is not hashed from a truncated prefix.
Execution IDs link the snapshot to graph version, run, replica and trace in the
existing execution record. No storage adapter/schema migration was necessary.

`GET /api/v1/graphs/{id}/instructions?node=...&replica=0` resolves current saved
configuration; it is not historical evidence. `GET
/api/v1/executions/{eid}/instructions` returns the immutable snapshot. Legacy
executions or turns that failed before context preparation return 404, rather
than inventing a snapshot. The console offers both views, including accepted
repository content, hashes, skill revisions and omission reasons.

Runtime Protocol v1 carries optional `instructions` as inert manifest data;
`prompt` contains composed optional guidance followed by the original agent
prompt, and operator messages remain in their existing fields/system context.
The Python SDK exposes `TurnInput.instructions`. Models/runtimes do not receive
new capabilities, environment variables or credentials through this mechanism.
`execution.instructions.loaded` reports counts and remaining budget with graph,
node and execution correlation; normal execution failure events record load
failures. Content is not logged by the new instruction loader.

## Verification

Use local Go (`make test GO="go -C server"`) or the documented container
wrapper. Targeted packages are `internal/instructions`, `internal/graph`,
`internal/api`, `internal/engine`; Python tests include an HTTP runtime round
trip. `SkillsView.test.tsx` tests administration, conflict retention, roles and
inspection. The Chromium journey is included in `make test-e2e`, using the disposable
controller and synthetic tools without the shared Docker daemon. To run only
this journey, use `cd web && npx playwright test --config playwright.instructions.config.ts`.
The shared configuration defaults to loopback port 18089; `LEFORGE_E2E_PORT`
selects another validated port for parallel sessions.
